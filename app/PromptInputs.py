        Hazard Description: The hazard of 'Water being spilt on the floor causing students to slip' during the activity 'Fluids laboratory' can lead to impact injuries.
        Prevention Explanation: 'Keeping the water tank stationary when it's full' means water cannot be spilled on to the floor by moving the water tank; no water on the floor reduces the likelihood of the student slipping; since it reduces the likelihood of the hazard event, it is a prevention measure.
        Mitigation Explanation: If water has been spilled on the floor, 'not moving the water tank when it is full' does not remove or reduce the harm caused by the hazard event, as the water is already spilled to pose a slipping hazard; as it does not reduce the harm caused by the hazard event, it is not a mitigation measure.

        Hazard Description: The hazard event of 'Cut Zip tie flies and hits audience member' during the activity 'Using a spring contraption as a demonstration for a TPS presentation' can lead to impact injuries.
        Prevention Explanation: 'Keeping hand around zip tie when cutting to stop it from flying' will stop the zip tie from flying and therefore stop the hazard event from occurring.

        Mitigation Explanation: If the hazard event occurs and the zip tie flies and hits an audience member, 'keeping hand around zip tie when cutting to stop it from flying' does not remove or reduce the impact injury caused by the hazard event, as the zip tie has already flown and caused harm; it is therefore not a mitigation measure.

        Description: The hazard of 'Ink spillage' during the activity 'Fluids laboratory' can lead to serious eye damage to students.
        How it Harms Explanation: 'Serious eye damage' is a way that this hazard causes harm because if ink comes into contact with the eyes, it can cause serious damage.
        Prevention Explanation: First aid will not reduce the likelihood of an ink spillage causing harm and it is a reactive step taken after the ink spillage; it therefore does not reduce the likelihood that the hazard causes harm and is not a prevention measure.
        Mitigation Explanation: If an ink spillage has led to serious eye damagen, first aid will help to wash the ink out of the eyes and reduce eye damage; as it reduces the harm, it is therefore a mitigation measure.
        Answer: Mitigation.'''

        Example Input:
        Follow these instructions:
        1. In one sentence, describe the hazard: 'Horse kicks out' during the
        activity: 'Mucking out a horse' given how the hazard harms: 'Impact injury'
        and who the hazard harms: 'Horse rider'.
        2. In one sentence, explain why "Impact injury" is a way that this hazard can cause harm.
        3. Explain whether or not 'Wear a helmet and body protector' reduces the likelihood that the hazard causes harm.
        If so, it is a prevention measure.
        4. Assuming the hazard described above does harm someone, explain whether or not 'Wear a helmet and body protector' reduces the harm.
        If so, it is a mitigation measure.
        5. If it is a prevention measure, answer 'Prevention'. If it is a migitation meausure, answer 'Mitigation'.
        If it is neither a prevention measure nor a mitigation measure, answer 'Neither'. If it is both a        
        prevention measure and a mitigation measure, answer 'Both'.
        
        Output:
        Description: The hazard of 'Horse kicks out' during the activity 'Mucking out a horse' can lead to impact injury to the horse rider.
        How it Harms Explanation: When a horse kicks out during mucking out, it can cause harm through impact injury, as the force of the kick can lead to bruises, fractures, or other injuries.
        Prevention Explanation: Wearing a helmet and body protector does not reduce the likelihood that the horse will kick and is therefore not a prevention measure.
        Mitigation Explanation: If a horse kicks the horse rider, wearing a helmet and body protector provides a protective barrier between the horse's kick and the person, hence reducing the impact injury caused by the horse's kick; as it reduces the harm, it is therefore a mitigation measure.
        Answer: Mitigation.

        Example Input:
        Follow these instructions:
        1. In one sentence, describe the hazard: 'Tripping over personal belongings' during the
        activity: 'Fluids laboratory' given how the hazard harms: 'Tripping can cause physical harm.'
        and who the hazard harms: 'Students'.
        2. In one sentence, explain why "Tripping can cause physical harm." is a way that this hazard can cause harm.
        3. Explain whether or not 'Take care when walking around' reduces the likelihood that the hazard causes harm.
        If so, it is a prevention measure.
        4. Assuming the hazard described above does harm someone, explain whether or not 'Take care when walking around' reduces the harm.
        If so, it is a mitigation measure.
        5. If it is a prevention measure, answer 'Prevention'. If it is a migitation meausure, answer 'Mitigation'.
        If it is neither a prevention measure nor a mitigation measure, answer 'Neither'. If it is both a

        Output:
        Description: The hazard of 'Tripping over personal belongings' during the activity 'Fluids laboratory' can lead to physical harm to students.
        How it Harms Explanation: Tripping can cause physical harm because it can result in falls, which can lead to injuries such as bruises, sprains, or fractures.
        Prevention Explanation: 'Take care when walking around' encourages students to be cautions and aware of their surroundings, making it less likely they will trip so it is a prevention measure.
        Mitigation Explanation: If a student has tripped over personal belongings, whether or not they were taking care when walking around will not affect how much harm the trip; as it does not reduce harm, it is therefore not a mitigation measure.
